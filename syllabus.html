<h2>Course Rationale</h2>
DTC 477 Advanced Web Design &amp; Development builds on the HTML/CSS skills developed in DTC 355 and provides a foundation in the main programming language for the web: JavaScript. By integrating various tools, design approaches and scripting languages (HTML5, CSS3 andJavascript), students create dynamic multimedia and interactive projects.&nbsp;

The CMDC aims to achieve three main goals: to 1) provide students with knowledge and skills for developing their own knowledge-making, 2) facilitate exploration, and 3) prepare students for the field and the world beyond.&nbsp;

<h2>General Project Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Projects should address usability, navigation, and design issues raised in this course and in DTC 355</li>
  <li>Projects should utilize attractive and effective design and layout</li>
  <li>JavaScript coding, HTML/CSS mark-up, site design and content <strong>must be your own work</strong>. You may use snippets of code and ChatGPT to build your project, but it may not be another's code that you call your own.</li>
  <li>Content should be substantive and should be <strong>written/created by you with the assistance of AI tools,</strong></li>
  <li><strong>All images not created by yourself or in collaboration with an AI image generator must be clearly labeled with ownership and copyright information</strong></li>
  <li>Projects should be checked thoroughly for errors. There is no excuse for sloppy writing or error filled code and such mistakes will count against you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Assessment and Final Grades</h2>
<p>Both attendance and participation will be monitored and deficiencies in either/both will result in lower&nbsp;final grades. Participation means being attentive in class, joining in discussions, engaging in informal&nbsp;critiques and completing all in-class and outside assignments.</p>

<p><strong>You are allowed 3 class absences. Each class absence after that will result in a 3-point deduction from the final cumulative points.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>It is your responsibility to make sure I check your attendance if you arrive after the start of class.&nbsp;Frequent late arrivals, leaving early, or other forms of lack of attendance will also deduct points from the cumulative total</strong>. Absent students remain responsible for all course matters during their absence(s). Opportunities to make up missed work may not be available.</p>

<h2>Submission of Late Work</h2>
<p>All work must be submitted as and when required. If you are sick or have an emergency, you must make contact with me (best to use Slack) and arrange a time to submit work.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b data-stringify-type="bold">Use of AI in This Course</b></h2>
<p>I do not prohibit the use of AI in this course since it is clear that it can assist with many tasks and expand your understanding and ability to do digital work, especially with coding. AI tools will become a standard practice in web design and development by the time you graduate.</p>

<p>That said, in order to use the AI tools properly, you need to understand JavaScript before your can manipulate scripts generated by AI. You will not be able to pass the class, by letting AI take over your own creative thinking.</p>

<p>Make an effort to read code, understand it and manipulate it tso that you can use these AI tools for fast iteration of your ideas. <em>You will need to document how and what you use for your projects from AI by detailing your steps and workflow in the comments of your source code</em>. I expect your use of AI to be a starting point for your output and that you will layer your own insights and creativity over it so that you can uniquely express yourselves.</p>
