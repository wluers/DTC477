<h3>Learning JavaScript</h3>
Computers are deterministic machines. They do exactly what they are told to do. Programming is the process of problem-solving <em>with</em> a computer, on its terms. Programming is not exactly a language but a way of thinking.
<h4>The Challenges of this Class:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>detail-work + testing + lots of frustrations! = learning</li>
  <li>logical/sequential/ordered thinking (step-by-step)</li>
  <li>macro/micro problem solving</li>
  <li>creative problem solving (big picture &lt; – &gt; small unit)</li>
  <li>interaction &amp; UX design&nbsp;</li>
  <li>AI Assistants for Web Design and Development and for Learning!: <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/pricing/">ChatGPT Pricing</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html">Eloquent JavaScript</a>: An excellent and free online book for understanding deeper concepts of JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Types of Projects with JavaScript</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Websites:</strong> practical tasks, dynamic navigation, animations with scroll or CSS animation</li>
  <li><strong>Stories/Poetry/Essays:</strong> Pagination, animation, interactivity</li>
  <li><strong>Web Apps:</strong> APIs, geolocation, databases</li>

<!-- <h3>In-Class Exercises</h3> -->
<!--<h4><strong>Class Contract in proper uses of AI Tools:</strong></h4>
Create a personalized class contract for appropriate and beneficial uses of AI tools for student learning: <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>

<em>ChatGPT prompt:</em> "Create a contract between students and the teacher in a class that will use ChatGPT to accelerate learning of digital techniques and technologies. The contact should start with "As a student of (class name) I (your name) will use ChatGPT to help me be a better and faster learner of digital technologies. I will use the ability of ChatGPT to explain and tutor me in the subject, in my preferred learning style, rather than use it to do all the work for me."&nbsp;

What are your learning goals and values in the use of AI and Machine Learning tools?&nbsp; Run your thoughts through ChatGPT for additions to the above contract.&nbsp;

Add new ideas from class. Run ChatGPT and post the paragraph as a comment to the class Contract post on the Slack channel. -->

</ul>
1-200 sum&nbsp;
<div style="display: none;">You can also do logically without any formulas. When you add first and last element (1+200=201) and second element and last before element (2+199=201). When you go on like this you will end up getting a pairs of 201. So how many pairs we can make?. Its 100 since total elements is 200 so if we make pairs then number of pairs are. (200/2 =100). Hence total sum is 201* 100= 20100. The idea is simply expressed as a general formula as i mentioned above.&nbsp;</div>

<em>Git Terms from <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/">Github Glossary</a></em>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Repository: </strong>A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.</li>
  <li><strong>Branch:</strong>A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Merge: </strong>Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A merge can be done through a pull request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line.</li>
  <li><strong>Clone: </strong>A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. The repository you cloned is still connected to the remote version so that you can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.</li>
  <li><strong>Pull: </strong>Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date. See also fetch.</li>
  <li><strong>Pull request: </strong>Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum.</li>
  <li><strong>Fork: </strong>A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository. You can also open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork synced with the latest changes since both repositories are still connected.</li>
  <li><strong>Fetch: </strong>When you use&nbsp;<code>git fetch</code>, you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them. Unlike&nbsp;<code>git pull</code>, fetching allows you to review changes before committing them to your local branch.</li>
  <li><strong>Push: </strong>To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them.</li>
  <li><strong>Commit: </strong>A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.</li>
  <li><strong>Markdown: </strong>Markdown is an incredibly simple semantic file format, not too dissimilar from .doc, .rtf and .txt. Markdown makes it easy for even those without a web-publishing background to write prose (including with links, lists, bullets, etc.) and have it displayed like a website. GitHub supports Markdown and uses a particular form of Markdown called GitHub Flavored Markdown. See GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec or Getting started with writing and formatting on GitHub.markup</li>

<h3>FTP Instructions</h3>
<h4>uploading files using an FTP (file transfer protocol) client</h4>
Steps to upload to remote server:
<ol>
  <li>In your free FTP client (Cyberduck or Filezilla) “Open Connection”</li>
  <li>Enter the following info:
<em>servername:</em>&nbsp;dtc-wsuv.org
<em>username:</em> first initial + last name +year started + @dtc-wsuv.org , all in lowercase, no spaces or symbols (so, “Sam Jones” who started DTC355 in 2025 would be “sjones25@dtc-wsuv.org”)
<em>password:</em> random password sent to you by Greg - it should be saved for you, look in history - the clock icon.</li>
  <li>If successful, you should be in your personal server directory that has the same name as your username (without the <em>@dtc-wsuv.org</em>) . Now you can either drag the folder and files in that directory or use the “action” menu to “upload”</li>
  <li>Upload folders and files in all lowercase with no spaces</li>
  <li>Make sure that your default page for the project is “index.html”</li>
  <li>Check how everything looks on the live absolute URL. Example: http://dtc-wsuv.org/sjones25/project/</li>
  <li>If you cannot see images, make sure that your file names and calls to access those files are all lowercase. Servers are case-sensitive!</li>
